Deletes a stream buffer that was previously created using a call to \doxylink{stream__buffer_8h_a39aa4dd8b83e2df7ded291f863fb5fed}{x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Create()} or \doxylink{stream__buffer_8h_a3c248575ac1b83801db605b32a118f77}{x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Create\+Static()}. If the stream buffer was created using dynamic memory (that is, by \doxylink{stream__buffer_8h_a39aa4dd8b83e2df7ded291f863fb5fed}{x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Create()}), then the allocated memory is freed.

A stream buffer handle must not be used after the stream buffer has been deleted.
