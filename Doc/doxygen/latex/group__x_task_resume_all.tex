Resumes scheduler activity after it was suspended by a call to \doxylink{task_8h_a366b302eba79d10b5ee2a3756f0fcc43}{v\+Task\+Suspend\+All()}.

\doxylink{task_8h_a003f8ae6d649225abd030cc76e1c7d0e}{x\+Task\+Resume\+All()} only resumes the scheduler. It does not unsuspend tasks that were previously suspended by a call to \doxylink{task_8h_a84d4e660b04630be2939d91b3c2412f8}{v\+Task\+Suspend()}.

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If resuming the scheduler caused a context switch then pd\+TRUE is returned, otherwise pd\+FALSE is returned.
