Suspends the scheduler without disabling interrupts. Context switches will not occur while the scheduler is suspended.

After calling v\+Task\+Suspend\+All () the calling task will continue to execute without risk of being swapped out until a call to x\+Task\+Resume\+All () has been made.

API functions that have the potential to cause a context switch (for example, \doxylink{task_8h_a067da3e949e248096ec6c01f9cb75a47}{v\+Task\+Delay\+Until()}, \doxylink{queue_8h_af7eb49d3249351176992950d9185abe9}{x\+Queue\+Send()}, etc.) must not be called while the scheduler is suspended.

Example usage\+: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
void \doxylink{6__1__muxtex_8c_a9be3b30062a2f95cd01ee38071933b3f}{vTask1( void * pvParameters )}

    for( ;; )
    \{
     // Task code goes here.

     // ...

     // At some point the task wants to perform a long operation during
     // which it does not want to get swapped out.  It cannot use
     // taskENTER\_CRITICAL ()/taskEXIT\_CRITICAL () as the length of the
     // operation may cause interrupts to be missed -\/ including the
     // ticks.

     // Prevent the real time kernel swapping out the task.
     vTaskSuspendAll ();

     // Perform the operation here.  There is no need to use critical
     // sections as we have all the microcontroller processing time.
     // During this time interrupts will still operate and the kernel
     // tick count will be maintained.

     // ...

     // The operation is complete.  Restart the kernel.
     xTaskResumeAll ();
