\begin{DoxyVerb}==============================================================================
                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
  [..]
  The FMPI2C HAL driver can be used as follows:

  (#) Declare a FMPI2C_HandleTypeDef handle structure, for example:
      FMPI2C_HandleTypeDef  hfmpi2c;

  (#)Initialize the FMPI2C low level resources by implementing the HAL_FMPI2C_MspInit() API:
      (##) Enable the FMPI2Cx interface clock
      (##) FMPI2C pins configuration
          (+++) Enable the clock for the FMPI2C GPIOs
          (+++) Configure FMPI2C pins as alternate function open-drain
      (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process
          (+++) Configure the FMPI2Cx interrupt priority
          (+++) Enable the NVIC FMPI2C IRQ Channel
      (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process
          (+++) Declare a DMA_HandleTypeDef handle structure for
                the transmit or receive stream
          (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock using
          (+++) Configure the DMA handle parameters
          (+++) Configure the DMA Tx or Rx stream
          (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the hfmpi2c DMA Tx or Rx handle
          (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete interrupt on
                the DMA Tx or Rx stream

  (#) Configure the Communication Clock Timing, Own Address1, Master Addressing mode, Dual Addressing mode,
      Own Address2, Own Address2 Mask, General call and Nostretch mode in the hfmpi2c Init structure.

  (#) Initialize the FMPI2C registers by calling the HAL_FMPI2C_Init(), configures also the low level Hardware
      (GPIO, CLOCK, NVIC...etc) by calling the customized HAL_FMPI2C_MspInit(&hfmpi2c) API.

  (#) To check if target device is ready for communication, use the function HAL_FMPI2C_IsDeviceReady()

  (#) For FMPI2C IO and IO MEM operations, three operation modes are available within this driver :

  *** Polling mode IO operation ***
  =================================
  [..]
    (+) Transmit in master mode an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_FMPI2C_Master_Transmit()
    (+) Receive in master mode an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_FMPI2C_Master_Receive()

         This action will inform Master to generate a Stop condition to discard the communication.


  *** Interrupt mode or DMA mode IO sequential operation ***
  ==========================================================
  [..]
    (@) These interfaces allow to manage a sequential transfer with a repeated start condition
        when a direction change during transfer

                          start condition, address and data to transfer without a final stop condition,
                          an then permit a call the same master sequential interface several times
                          (like HAL_FMPI2C_Master_Seq_Transmit_IT() then HAL_FMPI2C_Master_Seq_Transmit_IT()
                          or HAL_FMPI2C_Master_Seq_Transmit_DMA() then HAL_FMPI2C_Master_Seq_Transmit_DMA())

                            without stopping the communication and so generate a restart condition.
    (++) FMPI2C_OTHER_FRAME: Sequential usage (Master only), this option allow to manage a restart condition after
                          each call of the same master sequential
                          interface.

   *** FMPI2C HAL driver macros list ***
   ==================================
   [..]
     Below the list of most used macros in FMPI2C HAL driver.

    (+) __HAL_FMPI2C_ENABLE: Enable the FMPI2C peripheral
    (+) __HAL_FMPI2C_DISABLE: Disable the FMPI2C peripheral
    (+) __HAL_FMPI2C_GENERATE_NACK: Generate a Non-Acknowledge FMPI2C peripheral in Slave mode
    (+) __HAL_FMPI2C_GET_FLAG: Check whether the specified FMPI2C flag is set or not
    (+) __HAL_FMPI2C_CLEAR_FLAG: Clear the specified FMPI2C pending flag
    (+) __HAL_FMPI2C_ENABLE_IT: Enable the specified FMPI2C interrupt
    (+) __HAL_FMPI2C_DISABLE_IT: Disable the specified FMPI2C interrupt

   *** Callback registration ***
   =============================================
  [..]
   The compilation flag USE_HAL_FMPI2C_REGISTER_CALLBACKS when set to 1
   allows the user to configure dynamically the driver callbacks.
   Use Functions HAL_FMPI2C_RegisterCallback() or HAL_FMPI2C_RegisterAddrCallback()
   to register an interrupt callback.
  [..]
   Function HAL_FMPI2C_RegisterCallback() allows to register following callbacks:
     (+) MasterTxCpltCallback : callback for Master transmission end of transfer.
     (+) MasterRxCpltCallback : callback for Master reception end of transfer.
     (+) SlaveTxCpltCallback  : callback for Slave transmission end of transfer.
     (+) SlaveRxCpltCallback  : callback for Slave reception end of transfer.
     (+) ListenCpltCallback   : callback for end of listen mode.
     (+) MemTxCpltCallback    : callback for Memory transmission end of transfer.
     (+) MemRxCpltCallback    : callback for Memory reception end of transfer.
     (+) ErrorCallback        : callback for error detection.
     (+) AbortCpltCallback    : callback for abort completion process.
     (+) MspInitCallback      : callback for Msp Init.
     (+) MspDeInitCallback    : callback for Msp DeInit.
   This function takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle, the Callback ID
   and a pointer to the user callback function.
  [..]
   For specific callback AddrCallback use dedicated register callbacks : HAL_FMPI2C_RegisterAddrCallback().
  [..]
   Use function HAL_FMPI2C_UnRegisterCallback to reset a callback to the default
   weak function.
   HAL_FMPI2C_UnRegisterCallback takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle,
   and the Callback ID.
   This function allows to reset following callbacks:
     (+) MasterTxCpltCallback : callback for Master transmission end of transfer.
     (+) MasterRxCpltCallback : callback for Master reception end of transfer.
     (+) SlaveTxCpltCallback  : callback for Slave transmission end of transfer.
     (+) SlaveRxCpltCallback  : callback for Slave reception end of transfer.
     (+) ListenCpltCallback   : callback for end of listen mode.
     (+) MemTxCpltCallback    : callback for Memory transmission end of transfer.
     (+) MemRxCpltCallback    : callback for Memory reception end of transfer.
     (+) ErrorCallback        : callback for error detection.
     (+) AbortCpltCallback    : callback for abort completion process.
     (+) MspInitCallback      : callback for Msp Init.
     (+) MspDeInitCallback    : callback for Msp DeInit.
  [..]
   For callback AddrCallback use dedicated register callbacks : HAL_FMPI2C_UnRegisterAddrCallback().
  [..]
   By default, after the HAL_FMPI2C_Init() and when the state is HAL_FMPI2C_STATE_RESET
   all callbacks are set to the corresponding weak functions:
   examples HAL_FMPI2C_MasterTxCpltCallback(), HAL_FMPI2C_MasterRxCpltCallback().
   Exception done for MspInit and MspDeInit functions that are
   reset to the legacy weak functions in the HAL_FMPI2C_Init()/ HAL_FMPI2C_DeInit() only when
   these callbacks are null (not registered beforehand).
   If MspInit or MspDeInit are not null, the HAL_FMPI2C_Init()/ HAL_FMPI2C_DeInit()
   keep and use the user MspInit/MspDeInit callbacks (registered beforehand) whatever the state.
  [..]
   Callbacks can be registered/unregistered in HAL_FMPI2C_STATE_READY state only.
   Exception done MspInit/MspDeInit functions that can be registered/unregistered
   in HAL_FMPI2C_STATE_READY or HAL_FMPI2C_STATE_RESET state,
   thus registered (user) MspInit/DeInit callbacks can be used during the Init/DeInit.
   Then, the user first registers the MspInit/MspDeInit user callbacks
   using HAL_FMPI2C_RegisterCallback() before calling HAL_FMPI2C_DeInit()
   or HAL_FMPI2C_Init() function.
  [..]
   When the compilation flag USE_HAL_FMPI2C_REGISTER_CALLBACKS is set to 0 or
   not defined, the callback registration feature is not available and all callbacks
   are set to the corresponding weak functions.

   [..]
